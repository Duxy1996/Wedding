## Fonts ❤️

The fonts and colors are very important for transmitting emotions and feelings. Green is the main color; it conveys peace, relaxation, and joy. This shade of green is typical of Ireland's grassfields. Additionally, gold is used for the titles, complemented by the fonts "**BreamcatcherRg**", "**GoldroomD** and **Lato**," which draw inspiration from the Art Deco style.
