## Fonts ❤️

The fonts and colors are very important for transmitting emotions and feelings. Green is the main color; it conveys peace, relaxation, and joy. This shade of green is typical of Ireland's grassfields. Additionally, gold is used for the titles, complemented by the fonts "**BreamcatcherRg**", "**GoldroomD**" and "**Lato**" which draw inspiration from the Art Deco style.

Art Deco is a decorative style from the 1920s–30s characterized by bold geometric shapes, rich colors, and luxurious materials.
